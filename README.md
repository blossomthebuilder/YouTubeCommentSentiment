# Topic modeling and sentiment analysis on comments on a popular YouTube video. 

##Motivation
A few years ago, I created a video on how I unfollowed my inspiration, a woman named Erin on Demand. In the video, I share how it became easy for me to compare myself to her and instead of seeing her as inspiration, I judged myself as someone with bad work ethic who couldn’t nearly catch up with the times. I created this video to share that sometimes on our quest to find role models or people we look up to, our inspiration can easily be turned into self-degredation if we are not in the right state of mind. And I implored people to feel free to unfollow their inspirations if they felt moved to.
Because of this, I experienced great backlash from the video. Many people complained that I had clickbaited them, that I should have never made this video, that I’m bringing a fellow black woman down. Early on, I stopped reading comments to the video. 
But I did see that others could confide in what I shared. They held similar opinions when it came to following someone online who just seemed to have a picture perfect life. 

Even though this video received over 600 dislikes, I wanted to take a deeper dive in the comments section to see if the comments were as negative as I thought. I scraped all 200+ comments, used the Natural Language Processing Toolkit to conduct topic modeling and sentiment analysis to determine this.
