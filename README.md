# Using NLP to analyze comments on a controversial YouTube video.  

## Motivation
A few years ago, I created a video on how I unfollowed my inspiration, a woman named Erin on Demand. In the video, I share how it became easy for me to compare myself to her and instead of seeing her as inspiration, I judged myself as someone with bad work ethic who couldn’t nearly catch up with the times. I created this video to share that sometimes on our quest to find role models or people we look up to, our inspiration can easily be turned into self-degredation if we are not in the right state of mind. And I implored people to feel free to unfollow their inspirations if they felt moved to.
Because of this, I experienced great backlash from the video. Many people complained that I had clickbaited them, that I should have never made this video, that I’m bringing a fellow black woman down. Early on, I stopped reading comments to the video. 
But I did see that others could confide in what I shared. They held similar opinions when it came to following someone online who just seemed to have a picture perfect life. 

Even though this video received over 600 dislikes, I wanted to take a deeper dive in the comments section to see if the comments were as negative as I thought. I scraped all 200+ comments, used the Natural Language Processing Toolkit to conduct topic modeling and sentiment analysis to determine this. 
So in reality, we want to read YouTube comments. You only want to turn those YouTube comments into vectors so that our machine learning algorithm can decipher those comments and do what we want it to do with those comments.

## Description 
This algorithm analyzes the polarity of the comments and divides comments into 3 different topics to see if underlying themes persist.
